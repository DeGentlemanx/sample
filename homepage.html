					<h4>Health and Fitness Club (Captain)</h4> <br>
					<div>
					The Health & Fitness CCA imparts to its members and the school body relevant knowledge, skills and concepts to live a healthy and active lifestyle.	<br>
					Long distance running, functional fitness training, and Tchoukball are a few examples out of the variety of activities the club conducts for its members to keep fit with. <br>
					<br>
					As the captain of the club, I oversaw the weekly training sessions of 30+ members and delegated tasks to other committee members to execute operations and activities of the club,such as manning and maintainence of the school gym. <br>
					<br>
					I worked closely with the club's two vice captains and secretary to plan and host school-wide events such as the health and fitness week. Such large scale events consisted of multiple simultaneous activities, including fitness challenges, interhouse sports and educational presentations, held throughout the school. <br><br>

					<h4>Tchoukball Boysâ€™ Team (Captain)</h4> <br>
					Tchoukball is a non-contact, high-paced, ball sport. I was introduced to the sport through the Health and Fitness club and had quickly taken a liking to the unique style of the game. <br>
					<br>
					Unfortunately, MJC's tchoukball team did not have a coach and it was left to the leaders and members to plan and faciliate our own trainings with minimal guidance. As other schools competing in the tchoukball A division competition had professional tchoukball coaches, we were at a clear disadvantage.Despite this, our team greatly enjoyed the sport and would often initiate extra training sessions outside of CCA time and even do research on how professional teams' practice drills and tactics to apply in our own training. <br>
					<br>
					At the 2017 Tchoukball A-divisions, we were able to clinch the 1st Runner Up position, the greatest achievement in the history of MJC's tchoukball team.
